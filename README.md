This is a repository containing programs that use Google's API.

Google's API can be used with a variety of different languages, but these specifically use python.

# Comprehension of Code:
- some of the larger programs do not have many comments for understanding, however, some explanations can be found in the smaller programs
  - this is because the larger programs contain parts of the smaller programs
  - if you do not understand a section, please try to locate it in the other programs (note: not all explanations can be found)
- for importing APIs, there are two main ones used:
  - Google Cloud Vision APIs which are referred to by  "*from API_folder_name import cv2__library_folder as cv*" or "*from googlecloud ...*"
  - Python Weather (free) found [here](https://pypi.org/project/python-weather/)
